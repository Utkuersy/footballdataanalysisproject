# Football Data Analysis Project

## 📌 About the Project
This project aims to analyze football (soccer) data using **Python** and **data science techniques** to uncover insights about teams, players, and match performances. The analysis includes performance metrics, team comparisons, player statistics, and predictive modeling.

## 📊 Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning for predictive analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data exploration

## 🔍 Project Features
This project includes the following key analyses:
- **Match Statistics**: Goals, possession, shots, fouls, and other match-related metrics
- **Player Performance Analysis**: Evaluating individual player stats such as assists, goals, passing accuracy, etc.
- **Team Comparison**: Comparing different teams based on historical data
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes
- **Time Series Analysis**: Understanding trends in team and player performances over time
